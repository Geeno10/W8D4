|      |  A forgetful old hermit called Servillus has set up camp in a cave with his old, leather-bound potion book.                     |      |
|      |  Go to the cave and help him remember the recipe of his famous herbal tea.                                                      |      |

|      |  In order to validate the mission, you need to be in the cave with Servillus **and** your last command prior to ``gsh check``   |      |
|      |  must show the recipe (including its title), but nothing else.                                                                  |      |

 | / |                                                                                                                                   | \ |
 | / |  It is common for those commands to write their output to their "standard output", which means that (by default) the output is    | \ |
 | / |  written into the terminal.                                                                                                       | \ |

 | / |  Most of those commands can receive input either through files (given as arguments) or from their "standard input". For example:  | \ |
 | / |  - ``head FILE`` reads its input from the file,                                                                                   | \ |
 | / |  - ``head`` reads its input on the standard input.                                                                                | \ |
 | / |                                                                                                                                   | \ |
 | / |  By default, data from the standard input is read from the keyboard, but a pipe can change that.                                  | \ |
